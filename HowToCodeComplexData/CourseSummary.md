# How to Code Complex Data
## Topics covered in each week
### Week 1: Mutual Reference
- Functions on mutually referential data
- Arbitrary-arity trees
- Backtracking search

### Week 2: Two One-of Types & Local Expressions
- Generation of cross-product tables when working with two "one-of" data types
- Use of cross-product tables to generate examples and a template
- Use of cross-product tables to simplify the functions when possible
- Local expressions to encapsulate function definitions & avoid redundant computation
